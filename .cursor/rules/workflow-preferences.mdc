# Coding workflow prefernces

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architcture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicity instructed
- Always think about what other methods and ares of code might be affected by code changes
